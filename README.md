# ModComposer #

Compose game mods which overwrite or add files to a game in a non-destructive, reversible and easy-to-use manner. So if your mod composition fails, you can 
revert it as easy as the click on a button. Also, you can create overwriting-rules for specific mod files. So you can experiment and are always 100% in control of your personal
build.

It uses git under the hood to make every change reversible.
