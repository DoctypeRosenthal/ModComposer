# ModComposer #

Compose game mods to your hearts desire: overwrite or add files to a game in a non-destructive, reversible and easy-to-use manner. If your mod composition fails,
revert it as easy as the click on a button. Switch to another composition just as easy. If you really want to go wild, you can create overwriting-rules for specific mod files and mix your mods. 
Experiment and always be 100% in control of your personal build.

Uses git under the hood.
